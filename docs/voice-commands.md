## üé§ Voice Input Tips

### Best Practices

1. **Speak Clearly**
   - Use natural pace
   - Enunciate clearly
   - Maintain consistent volume

2. **Command Structure**
   - Start with action verb
   - Be specific
   - Use proper nouns for names

3. **Background Noise**
   - Minimize ambient noise
   - Use in quiet environment
   - Keep microphone close

### Command Variations

aiden understands multiple ways to express the same command:

```text
# Creating a project
"Create a new project called X"
"Start a project named X"
"Make a project X"

# Adding tasks
"Add task X to project Y"
"Create task X in Y"
"Make a new task X for project Y"
```

## ‚ö° Quick Commands

Common commands you'll use frequently:

```text
"What's my next task?"
"Show my priorities"
"List active projects"
"Generate code"
"Help me with [topic]"
```

## üîß Customization

You can customize voice command behavior in `config.yml`:

```yaml
voice:
  command_prefix: ""  # Optional prefix for commands
  confirmation_required: true  # Ask before destructive actions
  response_style: "concise"  # verbose/concise/minimal
  language: "en-US"  # Voice recognition language
```

## üö´ Limitations

- Complex code generation may require written input
- Some commands need specific formatting
- Background noise can affect recognition
- Some technical terms may need spelling

## üÜò Troubleshooting

If aiden doesn't recognize a command:

1. Try rephrasing
2. Use simpler terms
3. Break into smaller commands
4. Check microphone settings
5. Verify command syntax
