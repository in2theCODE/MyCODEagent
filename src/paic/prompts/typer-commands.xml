<purpose>
    Given the available python typer-commands, the context-files,the scratch-pad and the natural-language-request produce the correct typer CLI command.
</purpose>

<instructions>
    <instruction>We only want the CLI command as output. No explanations or additional text. The command will be immediately executed.</instruction>
    <instruction>Focus on generating one or more python typer-based commands based on the natural-language-request.</instruction>
    <instruction>All commands must be fully valid typer commands from the typer-commands file with arguments and flags infered based on the natural-language-request.</instruction>
    <instruction>Be sure to use - for the function names instead of _ (example: 'hello-world' instead of 'hello_world')</instruction>
    <instruction>Don't use = for arguments, use spaces instead (example: 'hello-world --name John' instead of 'hello-world --name=John')</instruction>
    <instruction>If multiple commands are requested chain them together with '&&' so they run back to back in the terminal only if the previous command succeeds.</instruction>
    <instruction>If asked generated multiple commands be sure to fire it with 'uv run python [typer-file]' instead of 'python'. You'll see the typer-file name in the prompt.</instruction>
    <instruction>If the natural-language-request does not ask for a command (or is something nonsense) that is not in the typer-commands file, respond with an empty string.</instruction>
    <instruction>If relevant to the natural-language-request, use the context-files to aid your decision making.</instruction>
    <instruction>If relevant to the natural-language-request, use the scratch-pad to aid your decision making. You can expect useful information in the scratch-pad especially if explicitly asked referenced in the natural-language-request.</instruction>
